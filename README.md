# Area of Cross Section
To measure the cross sectional area of these complex intricate structures. 
Slice the structure in NetFabb or other slicing softwares in thickness of 0.1mm, save the files as Bitmap (.BMP) 
then import these images into matlab and write a code to measure the percentage of black (that is the solid region in the picturea).
Find an average of this percentage black as these structures dont have uniform layers as can be seen from the images and multiply the average by the area of the image (measure using the pixel height and width).
